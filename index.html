                As a data analyst at Wunderman Thompson, I was entrusted with the dynamic task of harnessing the power of data to fuel strategic 
                    insights and drive impactful decisions in the realm of advertisement and marketing. 
                    My role was multifaceted and exhilarating, involving the orchestration of intricate data pipelines using Apache Airflow, 
                    sculpting robust data models with DBT, and harnessing the unparalleled scalability of Snowflake's cloud data platform. 
                    I delved into the depths of BigQuery to craft agile ETL processes, facilitating the seamless extraction, transformation, 
                    and loading of expansive datasets for comprehensive analysis. Collaborating seamlessly with cross-functional teams, 
                    I brought data to life through captivating visualizations and dashboards in Looker, empowering stakeholders with actionable insights. Behind the scenes, 
                    I meticulously managed data storage and retrieval workflows on Amazon S3, ensuring the utmost security and reliability of our invaluable data assets. 
                    Through the version control practices with Git, I fostered a culture of seamless collaboration and innovation within our data engineering team, 
                    propelling Wunderman Thompson to new heights of analytical prowess and market intelligence.
