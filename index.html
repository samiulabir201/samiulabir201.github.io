                <h3>Software developer</h3>
                <p>I am a 7th-semester graduating student,  pursuing a B.Sc. (Engg.) degree in 
                    Computer Science & Engineering at the Islamic University of Technology. 
                    As an aspiring software developer, I possess a strong ability to understand 
                    and analyze client requirements and have a solid understanding of software 
                    architecture design. I have strong analytical and problem-solving skills that 
                    enable me to transform business domain and specifications into high-quality code. 
                    Although I do not yet have the required 1-2 years of experience, I am confident 
                    in my ability to learn and adapt quickly. I am excited about the opportunity to 
                    work with a team of experts and make meaningful contributions to the software 
                    development industry.</p>

                    <p>A java based web application to order and deliver food online. It has three types of profile : Customer, Rider and admin.
                        Customer can see and add foods to cart and order multiple items together . Rider can see the 
                        pickup and delivery locations of the order and Admin can update the food items and see and cancel order.
                        Also it can locate riders location and approximate delivery time.</p>

                        finding home tutors and vice-versa.
                        The tutor rating is done based on patience, punctuality, effectiveness , clarity and review.  
                        Also help teachers find students based on nearest locations, salary and availability etc. 
                        Also a chatting system is implemented to maintain communication between both parties.</p>

                    <h3>Face_Mask_Project</h3>
                    <p>I created a face mask detection project using Python, Keras, OpenCV and MobileNet . 
                        The architecture I used here to train data is Convolutional Neural Network architecture (CNN). 
                        But instead of using traditional CNN, I used MobileNet architecture (as it takes very less 
                        computation power to run or apply transfer learning to). The image dataset to train the model 
                        is taken from Kaggle and some open-source image libraries and google images.</p>

                    <p>In this project I tried to perform facial recognition test with high accuracy result. 
                        The project creates a real-time attendance result of the persons after facial recognition.
                        I used a face recognition library by Adam Geitgey to recognize the faces and 
                        differentiate between different people. “SVM classifier” machine learning method was 
                        used to differentiate between different people and to find the matches.</p>
